# Rent-Calculator_Python-Project by Nikhil Kumar Singh
This Rent Calculator is a simple Python program designed to help users calculate the total rent over a specified number of months. 
By inputting the monthly rent amount and the number of months, the calculator multiplies the values to provide the total rent due for the selected period.
It’s an easy-to-use tool for tenants and landlords to quickly assess rental costs over time.

🚀Features

✅ Calculate total rent and split equally among roommates

✅ Support for custom share percentage (e.g., based on room size or agreement)

✅ Add utilities/extra charges (electricity, water, WiFi, maintenance, etc.)

✅ Simple command-line interface

✅ Modular & beginner-friendly Python code.

📊 Example Scenarios

Equal Split → ₹20,000 rent ÷ 4 roommates = ₹5,000 each

Custom Split → One roommate pays more based on room size (e.g., 40%-30%-30%)

With Utilities → Rent + utilities shared accordingly

📌 Future Improvements

Add GUI (Tkinter/Streamlit) for easier use

Export results to Excel/PDF

Store past rent records in a database or file
